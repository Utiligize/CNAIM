\arguments{
\item{ohl_conductor}{String.
A sting that refers to the specific asset category.
See See page 17, table 1 in CNAIM (2021).
Options:
\code{ohl_conductor = c("33kV OHL (Tower Line) Conductor",
"66kV OHL (Tower Line) Conductor", "132kV OHL (Tower Line) Conductor")}.
The default setting is
\code{ohl_conductor = "66kV OHL (Tower Line) Conductor"}.}

\item{sub_division}{String. Refers to material the conductor is
made of. Options:
\code{sub_division = c("ACSR - greased",
"ACSR - non-greased",
"AAAC",
"Cad Cu",
"Cu",
"Other")
}. See page 107, table 20 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{placement}{String. Specify if the asset is located outdoor or indoor.
A setting of \code{"Outdoor"} means the asset is
located in an outside environment,
and a setting of \code{"Indoor"} means the asset is located in an
 indoor environment. A setting of \code{"Default"} will result
  in either an indoor or an outdoor environment setting that depends
  on the specification of \code{asset_type}. See page 110-113,
  table 26 in CNAIM (2021) for default environments.}

\item{altitude_m}{Numeric. Specify the altitude location for
the asset measured in meters from sea level.\code{altitude_m}
is used to derive the altitude factor. See page 111,
table 23 in CNAIM (2021). A setting of \code{"Default"}
will set the altitude factor to 1 independent of \code{asset_type}.}

\item{distance_from_coast_km}{Numeric. Specify the distance from the
coast measured in kilometers. \code{distance_from_coast_km} is used
to derive the distance from coast factor See page 110,
table 22 in CNAIM (2021). A setting of \code{"Default"} will set the
 distance from coast factor to 1 independent of \code{asset_type}.}

\item{corrosion_category_index}{Integer.
Specify the corrosion index category, 1-5.
\code{corrosion_category_index} is used to derive the corrosion
category factor. See page 111, table 24 in CNAIM (2021).
A setting of \code{"Default"} will set the corrosion category factor
to 1 independent of \code{asset_type}.}

\item{age}{Numeric. The current age in years of the conductor.}

\item{conductor_samp}{String. Conductor sampling. Options:
\code{conductor_samp = c("Low","Medium/Normal","High","Default")}.
See page 161, table 199 and 201 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{corr_mon_survey}{String. Corrosion monitoring survey. Options:
\code{corr_mon_survey = c("Low","Medium/Normal","High","Default")}.
See page 161, table 200 and 202 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{visual_cond}{String. Visual condition. Options:
\code{visual_cond = c("No deterioration","Superficial/minor deterioration","Some Deterioration",
"Substantial Deterioration", "Default")}.
See page 146, table 140 and 142 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{midspan_joints}{Integer. Number of midspan joints on the conductor.
A span includes all conductors in that span.
See page 146, table 141 and 143 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{reliability_factor}{Numeric. \code{reliability_factor}
shall have a value between 0.6 and 1.5. A setting of \code{"Default"}
 sets the \code{reliability_factor} to 1.
See section 6.14 on page 73 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{gb_ref_given}{optional parameter to use custom reference values}
}
\value{
DataFrame Current probability of failure
per annum per kilometer along with current health score.
}
\description{
This function calculates the current
annual probability of failure per kilometer 33-132kV OHL conductors.
The function is a cubic curve that is based on
the first three terms of the Taylor series for an
exponential function. For more information about the
probability of failure function see section 6
on page 34 in CNAIM (2021).
