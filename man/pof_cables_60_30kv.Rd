}
\arguments{
\item{cable_type}{String.
A sting that refers to the specific asset category.
See See page 17, table 1 in CNAIM (2021).
Options:
\code{cable_type = c("30kV UG Cable (Gas)", "60kV UG Cable (Gas)",
"30kV UG Cable (Non Pressurised)", "60kV UG Cable (Non Pressurised)",
"30kV UG Cable (Oil)", "60kV UG Cable (Oil)")
}. The default setting is
\code{cable_type = "60kV UG Cable (Gas)"}.}

\item{sub_division}{String. Refers to material the sheath and conductor is
made of. Options:
\code{sub_division = c("Aluminium sheath - Aluminium conductor",
"Aluminium sheath - Copper conductor",
"Lead sheath - Aluminium conductor", "Lead sheath - Copper conductor")
}}

\item{utilisation_pct}{Numeric. The max percentage of utilisation
under normal operating conditions.}

\item{operating_voltage_pct}{Numeric. The ratio in percent of
operating/design voltage.}

\item{sheath_test}{String. Only applied for non pressurised cables.
Indicating the state of the sheath. Options:
\code{sheath_test = c("Pass", "Failed Minor", "Failed Major",
"Default")}. See page 153, table 168 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{partial_discharge}{String. Only applied for non pressurised cables.
Indicating the level of partial discharge. Options:
\code{partial_discharge = c("Low", "Medium", "High",
 "Default")}. See page 153, table 169 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{fault_hist}{Numeric. Only applied for non pressurised cables.
The calculated fault rate for the cable in the period per kilometer.
A setting of \code{"No historic faults recorded"}
indicates no fault. See page 153, table 170 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{leakage}{String. Only applied for oil and gas pressurised cables.
Options:
\code{leakage = c("No (or very low) historic leakage recorded",
"Low/ moderate", "High", "Very High", "Default")}.
See page 157, table 182 (oil) and 183 (gas) in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{reliability_factor}{Numeric. \code{reliability_factor}
shall have a value between 0.6 and 1.5. A setting of \code{"Default"}
 sets the \code{reliability_factor} to 1.
See section 6.14 on page 73 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{age}{Numeric. The current age in years of the cable.}

\item{gb_ref_given}{optional parameter to use custom reference values}
}
\value{
DataFrame Current probability of failure
per annum per kilometer along with current health score.
}
\description{
This function calculates the current
annual probability of failure per kilometer for a 30-60kV cables.
The function is a cubic curve that is based on
the first three terms of the Taylor series for an
exponential function. For more information about the
probability of failure function see section 6
on page 34 in CNAIM (2021).
